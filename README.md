# :toilet: Shell on the Shttr :toilet:
## The Blue Bag Update

Shell on the Shttr is a containerized backend web framework built using shell scripts.

The (somewhat depricated) live demo example page can be found at [shttr.io](https://shttr.io).

See the (very depricated) [instructions page](https://shttr.io/cgi-bin/readme.sh) at [shttr.io](https://shttr.io), or the (not depricated) [Shttr CLI](https://github.com/calebstein1/shttr) repo for more installation and usage instructions.

At this point with the Blue Bag Update, you're mostly on your own, but if you know how to deploy a Docker container and you don't need to use ShttrDB (currently broken in deployment), you'll be ok. Rest assured that new documentation and a fix for ShttrDB are on the way!
