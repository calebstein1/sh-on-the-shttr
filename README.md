# :toilet: Shell on the Shttr :toilet:

Shell on the Shttr is a cutting-edge, databaseless backend web framework built using shell scripts.

The live demo example page can be found at [shttr.io](https://shttr.io).

See the [instructions page](https://shttr.io/cgi-bin/readme.sh) at [shttr.io](https://shttr.io), or the [Shttr CLI](https://git.calebstein.net/calebstein1/shttr) repo for detailed installation and usage instructions.

Shell on the Shttr requires a functioning http server with CGI capability. It has been tested on Debian running Apache2, which works well.

Pandoc and postfix are optional dependencies for the PD and Mailer modules respectively.
