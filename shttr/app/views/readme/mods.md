###### Modules Instructions:

- Shttr Modules live in the ${SHTTR_LIB} directory.
- They are shell scripts that generally just define methods that can be used by the model, view, or controller to extend functionality.
- Some modules may have certain actions that are taken immediately upon sourcing, for example, the ESH module generating a Content-Type http header.
