  <p>Usage Instructions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All your app files belong in the shttr/app directory tree.</li>
    <li>The shttr/bin and shttr/lib directories are where Shttr app files and modules live.</li>
    <li>In order to create a new page, simply copy cgi-bin/index.sh to cgi-bin/NEW-PAGE.sh, then create the new files in shttr/app</li>
    <li>Any work your model does will be available to the view partials in MODEL_DATA. This will be changing soon so that the model can create multiple variables for the view.</li>
    <li>Look at shttr/app for the default page, it's pretty simple, you can probably figure it out.</li>
    <li>Modules can be used by a model, view, or controller by sourcing the module at the top of the script (ie. ". ${SHTTR_LIB}/MODULE_NAME").</li>
  </ul>
