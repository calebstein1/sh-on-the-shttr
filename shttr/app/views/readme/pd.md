###### PD Module Instructions

- If Pandoc is installed on the server, the PD module allows you to use any filetype that Pandoc supports in your views.
- Source pd in your view script, then use the pd method instead of v.
- The PD module does not currently support using ESH syntax in non-html files, though this is under development.
