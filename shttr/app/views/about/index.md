# About

Shell on the Shttr was created by [Caleb Stein](https://calebstein.net){target=_blank}, originally as a joke; then as way for me to streamline development of my own personal sites; and finally as a real, usable product (maintaining the joke name, of course).

It is a backend web framework built using shell scripts.

Shttr comes configured with [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/){target=_blank} as a frontend framework, and offers easy auto-configuration options for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com){target=_blank} and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com){target=_blank}. Shttr supports npm and NodeJS packages out of the box as well.
